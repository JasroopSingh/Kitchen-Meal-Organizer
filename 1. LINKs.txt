Memu - Switch Statements
  - https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_switch.asp
     - these are somewhat like if else Statements but with these u don't have to keep doing if else, if else. U assign 
     UserInput to this then U can have different cases for userInput that will be displayed when userInput matches vaule of one of the cases 
     
     Break: as it sounds breaks out of the switch block
     default: is code that will run if no matches to any of the cases is found
